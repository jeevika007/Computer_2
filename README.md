## Introduction
Welcome to the COA (Computer Organization and Architecture) project repository. This project, named "Computer-1", focuses on implementing and simulating a basic computer architecture model using Logisim. The aim is to provide an educational tool to understand the fundamental concepts of computer organization and architecture.
## Project Overview
The Computer-1 project includes the following components:

- ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- Register File
- Control Unit
- Memory (RAM)
- I/O Interface
- Basic Instruction Set
This project is designed to simulate the operations of a basic computer, demonstrating how different components interact to execute instructions.
## Features
- ALU Operations: Supports basic arithmetic and logical operations.
- Register File: A set of registers for storing intermediate data.
- Control Unit: Manages the execution of instructions.
- Memory: Simulates RAM for storing instructions and data.
- Instruction Set: Includes basic instructions such as ADD, SUB, LOAD, STORE, etc.
- I/O Interface: Basic input and output operations.
## Getting Started
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

Logisim (available at http://www.cburch.com/logisim/)
## Installation
- Download Logisim from the official website.
- Clone the repository
- Open Logisim and load the project file (computer-1.circ).

## Usage
To run the simulation:

1. Open Logisim.
2. Load the computer-1.circ file.
3. Use the simulation tools in Logisim to step through the instructions and observe the behavior of the computer architecture.

You can modify the instructions component in Logisim to change the instructions that the simulated computer will execute.
