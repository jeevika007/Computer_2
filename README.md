## Introduction
Welcome to the COA (Computer Organization and Architecture) project repository. This project, named "Computer-2", focuses on implementing and simulating an advanced computer architecture model using Logisim. The aim is to provide an educational tool to understand the complex concepts of computer organization and architecture.
## Project Overview
The Computer-2 project includes the following components:

- Advanced ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- Extended Register File
- Enhanced Control Unit
- Larger Memory (RAM)
- I/O Interface
- Comprehensive Instruction Set
This project is designed to simulate the operations of a more advanced computer, demonstrating how different components interact to execute complex instructions.
## Features
- Advanced ALU Operations: Supports complex arithmetic and logical operations.
- Extended Register File: A larger set of registers for storing intermediate data.
- Enhanced Control Unit: Manages the execution of complex instructions.
- Larger Memory: Simulates a larger RAM for storing instructions and data.
- Comprehensive Instruction Set: Includes a wider range of instructions such as MULT, DIV, AND, OR, etc.
- I/O Interface: Enhanced input and output operations.

## Getting Started
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

Logisim (available at http://www.cburch.com/logisim/)
## Installation
- Download Logisim from the official website.
- Clone the repository
- Open Logisim and load the project file (computer_2.circ).

## Usage
To run the simulation:

1. Open Logisim.
2. Load the computer_2.circ file.
3. Use the simulation tools in Logisim to step through the instructions and observe the behavior of the computer architecture.

You can modify the instructions component in Logisim to change the instructions that the simulated computer will execute.
